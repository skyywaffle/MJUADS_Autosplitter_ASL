 * Cheat engine address of any DeSmuME RAM Watch address:
 * "DeSmuME_0.9.13_x64.exe", (DeSmuME RAM Watch address + 8915400)
 *
 * Example: Address for San Fran Streets race placement
 * 
 * DeSmuME address: 023208E8
 * Cheat Engine address: DeSmuME_0.9.13_x64.exe+AC35CE8
 *
 * AC35CE8 - 23208E8 = 8915400
 *
 * This makes my job of finding LiveSplit-compatible memory addresses much easier.
